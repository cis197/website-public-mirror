# CIS 197 Website

This is a public, open source mirror of the CIS 197 website repository. The 197 site is private since it has scripts, solutions, and build files which are needed to release HW assignments and to assist in deploying the site statically to Penn's servers.

For those with access to the private site, to update this repo, clone it and then run:

```bash
source ./mirror.sh
```
