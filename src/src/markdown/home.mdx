### Course Description

<InfoMessage showIcon>
  This course meets Thursdays from 3:00pm to 4:30pm. Location Towne 303.
</InfoMessage>

This course provides an introduction to modern JavaScript: frameworks, design patterns, techniques, and best practices used to create robust applications both server-side and client-side. The emphasis will be on sampling a wide range of JavaScript use cases. The topics covered will include:

- JavaScript language
- Web browser internals, the Document Object Model (DOM), jQuery, HTTP requests
- Webkit developer tools & JS debugging
- MV\* frameworks (ReactJS)
- Client-side app architecture, modular JS development & best practices
- Server-side app architecture (with ExpressJS), middleware, and RESTful API design
- JS history and universe
- What does _good_ JavaScript look like?

This course is most useful for students who have some programming and web development experience and want to develop moderate JavaScript skills to be able to build complex, interactive applications.

There are many, many JS frameworks (far more than we can cover in this course). Our goal is to teach relevant frameworks and concepts which will enable you to pick up any other framework upon completing the course.

### Prerequisites

- CIS 120 or equivalent (or permission of instructor).
- Some knowledge of HTML/CSS (if you don't meet this requirement, you are expected to pick up the basics on your own with online resources like [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/) and [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)).

### Policies

Homework will be graded out of 25 points: 15 for correctness (automatically graded), 5 for JavaScript best practices (automatically graded), and 5 for code style (manually graded). Grading will follow the [style guide for the course](/style) - please ask on Piazza if you have a specific question that is not covered here.

Please note that the code style grade is additive, not subtractive; if you do not complete a homework, you will not receive 5 style points for ‘making no errors,’ but rather 0 style points for writing no code at all.

You have two **free** late days to use throughout the course. After this, late submissions will be docked **20%** for every day late. Additional extensions will _**only**_ be granted in truly extenuating circumstances.

If a submission doesn't run (i.e. has syntax errors), we will not be lenient -- you will likely receive zero credit. Please start assignments early and use office hours to your advantage.

**See the [course syllabus](/syllabus) for more detailed policies and grading info.**

### Logistics

We use CampusWire instead of Piazza for asking questions and sharing updates about the course. You can join [here](https://campuswire.com/c/G35F55F77/feed).

Homeworks are submitted to Gradescope with course code MN533B. You can submit an unlimited number of times. The majority of homeworks have automated test cases which run immedaitely after you submit, allowing you to check your work.

All 19x courses have a shared "lecture" which meets for the first three weeks at the start of the semester and does not meet after. The "recitation" as listed in PennInTouch is the actual course. This meets once a week throughout the entire semester.
