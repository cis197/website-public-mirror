# CIS 197 F19 Final Project Document

The final project consists of 3 milestones and a presentation. Milestones exist so that you are incentivized to not hold off working on your project until the very last moment. JavaScript is BUGGY and having the foresight to see JS bugs isn’t something that comes until you’ve completed many projects.

## Basic Requirements

Though the choice of what your project should accomplish is up to you, we have a few basic requirements that must be a part of your application. If you have an idea that you really want to build but doesn’t meet the criteria below, then you can speak to a TA for override. Otherwise, every final project must

- Have a notion of users and accounts
- Use a database
- Have a frontend
- Use express

Other than these requirements, you’re free to build whatever you want.

### Examples of previous final projects

- Collaborative, realtime drawing in 3D-space using three.js, socket.io

### Cool || Useful Frameworks/Libraries

- Passportjs (for managing users and logins, ‘Login with Facebook’, ‘Login with Google’)
- Mongoose (for interfacing with MongoDB databases)
- Sequelize (for interfacing with MySQL databases)

### Final Project Ideas (most haven’t been done)

- A better when2meet that actually works on mobile and isn't from the 1990s... (and integrates with your google calendar or iCal CalDAV/rss feed... my my that would be amazing)
- React Native application for organizing spontaneous meetups with friends
- Messenger Bot for roommate management (schedule chores, split bills, add grocery items, and add check in functionality for all roommates). Node backend + Mongodb + facebook messenger API
- Social network (tinder but for dogs... or something like that) with the ability to create profiles, share content, and friend users. React + Redux frontend + node backend + mongodb needed
- Extension of any of the homeworks (but be sure to consult us on this to see if it is reasonably complex enough e.g. Redoing the stock portfolio but in react)

## Step 1: Project Proposal + TA approval - 10 points

### Due Dates

Proposal Submitted: **Monday, November 4**

TA Approval: **Friday, November 8**

You’ll need to writeup and submit a final project proposal on Canvas by Friday Nov 1st. The project proposal should consist of the following items

- Overview (brief description of what you hope to build and what your project will accomplish)
- Feature list (detailed view into what users will be able to do on your application)
- Technologies/frameworks/libraries needed or used
- Milestone breakdown (what features you will accomplish by which milestone)

After you’ve submitted your proposal, make sure to schedule a phone call with a TA or show up to their office hours. They’ll help you scope your project well and choose the appropriate libraries. Contact your TAs over email (on the course website)

## Step 2: Milestones 1, 2, & 3 (25 points each)

### Due Dates

#### Milestone 1: Friday, November 15

Your milestone 1 submission should simply consist of a link to your Github repository. For now, the latest commit is the one we will go off of to grade milestone 1 submissions. There is an assignment on Canvas for you to submit. Make sure your repository is public.

Milestone 2: Friday, November 22

Milestone 3: Monday, December 2

Milestone submission guidelines will be updated in the near future. They will likely be done by tracking commits on Github.
