## Code Style

Code style is extremely important when developing code that you hope to last
longer than its first writing. This is especially important with JavaScript
because the interpreter is very tolerant and will allow a great deal of
syntactic mistakes to pass undetected when code is executed. JS developers must
exhibit great discipline in writing idiomatic code that is easily readable to
all other developers.

Because of this, we're going to be adhering to a style guide for code written in this class. If you ever go out and write code professionally, you would do
well to adhere to a structured style guide as well.

## Basics

**Indentation**: Use spaces, not tabs. 2 or 4 spaces.

**Line Length**: Avoid lines longer than 100 characters.

**Comments**: Be generous with comments, but try to describe more about _why_
code is the way it is, and the assumptions it makes, rather than _how_ it does things. JavaScript is an expressive enough language (with first class functions, etc.) that you can write very readable code that expresses intent properly.

**Whitespace**: Most tokens should be separated by whitespace. Specifically, you should always have a space before and after your infix operators (`+`, `-`, `&&`, etc). Also use whitespace between the function keyword and its arguments:

<Code
  code={`
var parseInt = function (string, radix) {
  ...
};
`}
  language="javascript"
/>

`if / else` blocks and `for / while` loops should always be split into lines,
as per the K&R standard (aka **[The One True Brace Style](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?OneTrueBraceStyle)**):

<Code
  code={`
if (predicate) {
  ...
} else {
  ...
}
 
for (var i = 0; i < len; i++) {
  ...
}
 
while (condition) {
  ...
}
`}
  language="javascript"
/>

## Functions

Functions should generally be declared by assigning to an identifier:

<Code
  code={`
var parseInt = function (string, radix) {
  ...
};
`}
  language="js"
/>

If you use an _identifier_ with a function expression, it provides the added
benefit of showing up with a proper identifier in stack traces &mdash; but this is not strictly necessary.

<Code
  code={`
var parseInt = function parseInt (string, radix) {
  ...
};
`}
  language="js"
/>

**_Do not_** use a function _definition_ syntax like the following example, because the scoping works slightly differently â€“ this
function is "hoisted" to the top of its scope while the above _function
expression_ syntax means that a function is only available when its expression
is evaluated (and stored to that variable).

<Code
  code={`
// Don't use this syntax!
function parseInt (string, radix) {
  ...
};
`}
  language="js"
/>

## Operators

**_Do not_** use the double-equal `==`. It does type coercion and is [generally recognized as a bad idea](http://www.impressivewebs.com/why-use-triple-equals-javascipt/).

**_Do_** use the triple-equal `===`, which does _strict equality_.

**_Do not_** perform assignments in the conditional of `if` and `while` statements. It is easy to mistake an assignment like this one...

<Code code="if (a = b) { ... }" language="js" />

...for an equality check like this one:

<Code code="if (a === b) { ... }" language="js" />

**_Do not_** use `eval` in your programs. Similarly, **_do not_** use the `Function` constructor or pass strings to `setTimeout` / `setInterval`. We'll never ask you to do these weird hacky sorts of things - this class is about encouraging _good_ code.

**_Do not_** use bitwise operators (`&`, `|`, and `~`) in place of logical operators (`&&`, `||`, and `!`).

Similarly, [**_do not_** use the `with` statement](http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/04/11/with-statement-considered-harmful/).

**_Do not_** [use the `for-in` loop for arrays ](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/500504/why-is-using-for-in-with-array-iteration-such-a-bad-idea). You can use if for objects, but this isn't necessary either - if you need to iterate over an object's properties, you should probably use `Object.keys`.

## Code Cruft

**_Do not_** leave debugging-type functions (like `console.log` or `alert`) in your finished code. The obvious exception is in cases where writing to the console, or displaying an alert message, is the intended function of the code.

## IIFEs

Finally, you may want to include an [Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)](http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/) in your JavaScript files to avoid polluting the global namespace - but this is not strictly necessary.

<Code
  code={`
(function() {
  // do stuff
  
  module.exports = {
    // export stuff
  }
})()
`}
  language="js"
/>

## ESLint

In order to do ensure that your JavaScript submissions adhere to this style guide, we will be using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/). You should definitely check your code style with ESLint before submitting - see [Lecture 1](build/lectures/lecture1.pptx) for instructions on how to use ESLint.

We will provide you with a specific `.eslintrc` file for each homework, but they will all have these rules (which are among the best-accepted and most general JavaScript style guidelines).

<Code
  code={`
{
  "env": {
    "node": true
  },
  "rules": {
    "brace-style": [2, "1tbs"],
    "camelcase": 0,
    "no-alert": 2,
    "no-bitwise": 2,
    "no-empty": 2,
    "no-ex-assign": 2,
    "no-lonely-if": 2,
    "no-loop-func": 2,
    "no-mixed-spaces-and-tabs": 2,
    "no-tabs": 2,
    "no-underscore-dangle": 0,
    "no-unused-vars": 0,
    "quote-props": [2, "as-needed"],
    "space-before-function-paren": [2, "never"],
    "quotes": [2, "single", "avoid-escape"],
    "space-before-blocks": 2,
    "space-infix-ops": 2,
    "strict": 0
  }
}
`}
  lang="js"
/>

The specific definitions for these rules can be found in [the ESLint rules documentation.](http://eslint.org/docs/rules/) Including them in your final project would probably be a good idea as well - it could save you a great deal of trouble down the line!
