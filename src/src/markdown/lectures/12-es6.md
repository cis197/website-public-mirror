# What is ES6?

ES6 (aka ES2015) is the newest version of ECMAScript (aka JavaScript). Its spec was just finalized this year, and although it's still in the 'experimental' phase, it looks like it should clean up some of the most verbose parts of JavaScript!

ES6 has a lot of syntax changes from ES5 (which is what we've been working with up until this point). Some of these changes are entirely new, while others are just syntactic sugar for code we've already seen. We'll take a look at some of the most interesting ones in this lecture.

# Enabling ES6 with Babel

class: large

# Configuring Babel

Whether you're working in Node or in the browser, you'll need a configuration file to get Babel working properly. This file is called `.babelrc`, and it's written in plain JSON. Babel can pull in a [lot of different options](http://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/) from this file, but in general you'll just want the `es2015` preset, which enables all ES6 features.

```json
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
```

# Enabling ES6 in Node

To enable ES6 in Node, you'll need [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) to transform your ES6 files into ES5 that Node can understand. To do this, all that's required (pun intended!) is to require the `'babel-core/register'` module. Once this is done, Babel will automatically convert your beautiful ES6 code into not-so-beautiful ES5 on the fly.

```js
require('babel-core/register')

// This file contains your actual code, in ES6
require('./shiny-es6-file')
```

# Enabling ES6 in the Browser

Enabling ES6 in the browser is a little bit trickier, because there's no `require` variable for Babel to mess with. We have a few options:

1. We could use RequireJS or some other similar library, set to use Babel to transform ES6 to ES5 on the fly.
2. We could use the Babel CLI to transform the files from the command line every time we make changes
3. We could use the Babel plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/babel/gulp-babel) or [grunt](https://github.com/babel/grunt-babel), and add a Babel step to a larger build chain (which might include [live reloading](https://github.com/vohof/gulp-livereload), [concatenation](https://github.com/contra/gulp-concat), [minification](https://github.com/terinjokes/gulp-uglify), etc.)

I almost always go with #3 because a build system speeds up development a lot. It's worth the time investment to get it working.

# Variable Declarations

---

class: med-large

We already know about `var`, which is the only declaration keyword in ES5. It works fine, but it's hoisted to the top of the scope it was declared in, which can lead to unexpected results.

```js
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

console.log(i) // Prints 10

if (true) {
  var xyz = 14
}

console.log(xyz) // 14
```

---

class: med-large

The reason that code works the way it does is that `var` declarations are in scope for the entire function they were declared in (or globally, if they're defined in the global scope). The above code is executed by the JavaScript engine as:

```js
// Hoisted vars
var i, xyz

for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}

console.log(i) // Prints 10

if (true) {
  xyz = 14
}

console.log(xyz) // 14
```

---

class: med-large

ES6 provides two new ways to declare variables: `let` and `const`.

`let` works almost exactly like `var`, except it's _block-scoped_. It only exists inside the curly braces { } that it was declared in. An attempt to reference a variable declared with `let` outside of its scope is a ReferenceError.

`const` is stricter still: a variable declared with `const` can _never be reassigned_. An attempt to do so will raise an error. This makes `const` very useful for declaring constants (like the number of degrees in a circle). In fact, it's good style to use `const` for _any_ variable that is never meant to be reassigned!

# Template Strings

---

class: med-large

Strings in JavaScript have always been fairly annoying to work with. You can't include variables without concatenating with +, and there aren't multiline strings either.

```js
var emotion = 'sad'
var str =
  'Oh ES5 strings\n' +
  'You make me so very ' +
  emotion +
  '\n' +
  'It is snowing on Mt. Fuji.'
```

ES6 supports a _template string_ syntax to get around these issues. Template strings are defined with backticks, and they support multiple lines and variable substitutions.

```js
const emotion = 'giddy with joy'
const str = `Template literals
You make me ${emotion}
It is snowing on Mt. Fuji.`
```

---

class: med-large

Template strings are actually much more powerful than just variable substitutions. You can put anything into a template's substitution expression, including function calls:

```js
const message = BACKTICK_LITERALThe price is $${getItemCost()}BACKTICK_LITERAL;
```

## You can also define a _tag function_ to parse a template literal and make your own substitutions. This can be used to do common string manipulation tasks like HTML escaping really easily!

# Arrow Functions

---

class: med-large

Arrow functions are a tidier way to define a function in ES6. Rather than a function keyword, you can just use the following syntax:

```js
const func = () => {
  console.log('Func!')
  return 0
}
```

Arrow functions that are one line long do not even need braces or a return statement:

```js
const add = (a, b) => a + b
console.log(add(1, 2)) // Prints 3
```

---

class: med-large

Arrow functions have a one more very cool feature: they inherit the `this` context of the function where they were created. This means that you don't have to bind `this` to functions anymore - it's automatic!

```js
;(function () {
  const f = () => console.log(this)
  f()
}.bind({ k: 'v' })())
// Prints {k: 'v'}
```

---

class: med-large

All functions (not just arrow functions) have gotten a few upgrades in ES6. The first is _default argument values_ which are assigned to function arguments if they are undefined.

```js
const add = (a, b = a) => a + b
```

In addition, argument _splats_ are now a full-on language feature, allowing functions to take in any number of arguments.

```js
const add = (...nums) => {
  return nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0)
}
```

There's also a parallel _spread operator_ that lets you pass in arrays as multiple parameters.

```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(add(...arr))
```

---

class: med-large

A final cool feature of ES6 functions is _tail call optimization_. Essentially, tail call optimization means that if a function A is called as the last statement of function B, then A is removed from the stack before B begins its execution. This makes it possible to implement functions like factorial recursively without causing a stack overflow. Neat!

```js
function factorial(n, p = 1) {
  if (n <= 1) {
    return 1 * p
  } else {
    let result = n * p

    // optimized
    return factorial(n - 1, result)
  }
}
```

# Objects and Arrays

---

class: med-large

Objects come with some cool new features in ES6. The first is concise method syntax, which makes defining methods a lot more pleasant:

```js
let dog = {
  speak() {
    console.log('Woof!')
  },
}
```

The second is _object structuring_, which allows you to assign a variable name to a property more concisely.

```js
let name = 'Carl',
  age = 22
//ES6 object structuring
let person = { name, age }

// ES5 equivalent
person = { name: name, age: age }
```

---

class: med-large

The third is _destructuring_, which is the opposite of structuring. It lets you break down an object into properties, which you can then use as variables.

```js
let person = { name: 'Carl', age: 22, job: 'Farmer' }

let { name, age } = person
```

You can also destructure arrays:

```js
let arr = [1, 2, 3]
let [, second, third] = arr

console.log(second, third) // 2, 3
```

---

class: med

The final addition we'll discuss is _getter and setter methods_, which allow you to use property syntax to call object methods.

What does this actually mean? Well, consider what happens when you assign an index in an array, like `arr[3]`. This is a getter behind the scenes, because this assignment might change the length of the array - which is a side effect. Now we can define our own getters and setters with side effects of their own!

```js
let obj = {
  _prop: 'value',
  get prop() {
    console.log('getting prop')
    return this._prop
  },
  set prop(val) {
    console.log('Setting prop')
    this._prop = val
  },
}
let x = obj.prop
obj.prop = 'new-value'
```

# Classes

---

class: med-large

Classes finally exist in ES6, and their syntax is really nice!

```js
class Person {
    constructor (name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    greet () {
        console.log(BACKTICK_LITERALHi, I am ${this.name}BACKTICK_LITERAL);
    }
}

const bob = new Person('bob');
bob.greet();
```

Under the hood, this still sets up the prototype chain as normal. But it looks a lot nicer!

---

class: med, smallest-code

Classes support static members, which is often quite useful.

```js
class Circle {
  static get DEGREES_IN_CIRCLE() {
    return 360
  }
}
```

Classes can also extend other classes:

```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(w, h) {
    this.width = w
    this.height = h
  }

  get area() {
    return this.width * this.height
  }
}

class Square extends Rectangle {
  constructor(length) {
    super(length, length)
  }
}
```

---

For classes that extend other classes, you can use `super` in two ways. We've already seen the first: calling `super()` from the constructor in order to initialize the superclass. You can also get a reference to the "prototype" class using `super` in a method:

```js
class LoudSquare extends Square {
  get area() {
    console.log('WE ARE GETTING AREA!')
    return super.area
  }
}
```

Note that `super` is capable of looking multiple levels up the inheritance chain. Here, `super.area` refers to the `area` getter method from the Rectangle class.

# ES6 Modules

---

class: med

For the longest time, NodeJS hacked around the idea of modules by implementing a `require` function. There was no 'standard' module spec for the language. ES6 changes all this with two new keywords: `import` and `export`.

Exports and imports are fairly simple. A module (in practice, a file) can export any number of named variables, as well as a 'default' value. Then other modules can import those variables by name, or just import the default.

```js
// myModule.js
export var size = 14
export let color = 'red'
export default 'DefaultValue'
```

```js
import { size, color } from './myModule'
import name from './myModule'

console.log(size, color, name)
// Prints 14, red, DefaultValue
```

Note the lack of curly braces when we import the default value.

---

class: med-large

We can also rename variables when we import them - we're not tied down to the names that the module authors used.

```js
import { size as bigness, default as name } from './myModule'
```

Finally, if we just want to import everything, we can do that too:

```js
import * as all from './myModule'

console.log(all)
// {size: 14, color: 'red', default: 'DefaultValue'}
```

---

class: med-large

# Module Naming Conventions

It would be really cool if there were a 'standardized' way to refer to modules in ES6, but there isn't one. Importing from Node works pretty much the same way it did with `require`, but the browser plays by its own rules. It's best just to let Babel take care of such inconsistencies!

# You made it!

Congratulations! CIS 197 is over now, and you officially know JavaScript. I hope you all enjoyed the class as much as I enjoyed teaching it.

Best of luck on your final projects, and let me know if you ever need anything - JavaScript related or otherwise!
